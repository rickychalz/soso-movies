Filtering: I had a hard time trying to find a way to combine filtering for tv shows and movies so i had to resort to implementing different filters for movie content and for tv show content
Content Display: Though I managed to achieve displaying media using single component it was a challenge to implement separation of the content still proves to be the better option


Known Issues
Filter Bugs: Filtering sometimes doesnâ€™t update correctly when switching between Movie/TV show views.
